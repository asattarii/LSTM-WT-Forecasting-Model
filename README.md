# LSTM-WT-Forecasting-Model
A generative-based machine learning framework for streamflow forecasting, designed to accurately predict streamflow at various lead times. This repository includes the LSTM-WT forecasting model code used in our paper, "Enhancing Flood Forecasting Using Time Generative Adversarial Network."
